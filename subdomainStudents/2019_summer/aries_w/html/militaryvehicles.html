					<p>
						The M1 Abrams is a third-generation American main battle tank named after General Creighton Abrams and designed by Chrysler Defense (now General Dynamics Land Systems). 
						Designed as a highly mobile main-battle tank for modern armored ground warfare,[14] the M1 is well armed and heavily armored. 
						The Abrams introduced several notable and innovative features such as a powerful 1500 hp AGT1500 multifuel turbine engine, sophisticated Chobham composite armor, 
						a computer fire control system and separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment along with NBC protection for crew safety. 
						While the initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, 
						later variants feature a licensed Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44 for increased firepower. Weighing nearly 68 short tons (almost 62 metric tons), 
						it is one of the heaviest main battle tanks in service.

					<h2> High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV; colloquial: Humvee) </h2>
					<h3> Produced by AM General </h3>
					<h3> Primary User: US Army </h3> 
					<h4> Following is from Wikipedia </h4>
					<p> 
						The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV; colloquial: Humvee) is a family of light, four-wheel drive, military trucks and utility vehicles produced by AM General. 
						It has largely supplanted the roles previously performed by the original jeep, and others such as the Vietnam War-era M151 jeep, the M561 "Gama Goat", 
						their M718A1 and M792 ambulance versions, the Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle (CUCV), and other light trucks. Primarily used by the United States military, 
						it is also used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian adaptations. The Humvee saw widespread use in the Gulf War of 1991, 
						where it negotiated the treacherous desert terrain; this usage helped to inspire civilian Hummer versions. After going through a replacement process, 
						the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) was chosen as its successor.
