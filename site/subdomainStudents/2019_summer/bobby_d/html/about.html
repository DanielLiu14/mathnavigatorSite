      <h4 id="groupDescription">What started as an inside joke before the 2018 DCXC meet turned into a group of the freshmen at the time, the class of 2022. Instead of running in the "fresh" race they were running in the "frosh" race. Never hesitating, they used this opportunity to have some fun and the name "Froshmemes" was created. The group now encompasses not only runners in the class of 2022 but the class of 2023 as well. The Froshmemes now have a Youtube channel where they create movies and other content.</h4>
