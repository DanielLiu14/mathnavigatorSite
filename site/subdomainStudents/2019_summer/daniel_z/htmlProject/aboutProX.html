			<p>The goal of making this website is to talk about all of the 
			missions that will occur in the 2020s to go to the moon, Mars, and
			beyond, to explore new planets and see if they host life. Our 
			primary purpose of going back to the Moon is to build a lunar colony
			there and mine really useful minerals so we can go back to Mars.</p>
		
			<p>What makes space so facsinating? When people look out into space,
			they can see the beautiful stars in the sky. Since space is so vast,
			it is up to 46 billion light years and our Earth is small compared
			to that size. Astronomer Edwin Hubble was the first person who 
			discovered the cosmos so engineers named the telescope after him.
			Earth may not be the only planet with life, there are many other
			Earth-sized planets out there dozens or hundreds of light years from
			Earth that could be able to support life. Many telescopes made 
			astonishing discoveries ranging from Earth-like planets that could 
			support life to new discoveries about galaxies.</p>
