			<p>1. Located 110 light years from Earth,K2-18b is a recently 
			discovered exoplanet in the habitable zone that has water 
			vapor detected in its atmosphere.</p>	
			
			<p>2. While Kepler-22b is located 587 ligth years from Earth
			in the constellation Cygnus, this exoplanet orbits a Sun-like
			star. Further discovery could be made with more powerful 
			telescopes.</p>
			
			<p>3. Proxima Centauri b is the closest planet to Earth located 
			4 light years from Earth. It orbits a red dwarf star 20 times
			closer than the Earth orbiting the sun. It might be able to 
			host alien life.</p>
			
			<p>4. Europa is one of Jupiter's Gallileian moons that contains 
			oceans of water 10 to 15 miles below the thick icy crust. The 
			ocean stretches up to 40 to 100 miles in depth. The Europa Clipper
			could launch in 2025 to look for alien life.</p>
			
			<p>5. Kepler-452b is located 1,110 light years from Earth that has 
			been confirmed to be the first near-Earth planet in the habitable
			zone</p>
			
			<p>6. The Trappist 1 System is a system of 7 Earth-like planets 
			discovered in 2017. 3 of the 7 planets are in the habitable zone
			and could contain liquid water.</p>
			
			<p>7. Gliese-667Cc is an exoplanet orbiting the star Gliese-667Cc
			which is a triple star system. The exoplanet has a landscape
			just like Star Wars Tatoonie and it could host alien life
			located 23 light years from Earth.</p>
			
			<p>8. Ross-128b is discovered to be 11 light years from Earth,
			the second nearest exoplanet to Earth. It orbits a very 
			inactive red dwarf star which could make it possible for 
			alien life to exist</p>
			
			<p>9. Mars is one of the planets in our solar system that 
			many space companies such as NASA and SpaceX are trying to 
			go to and attempt to colonize the planet. The First space 
			mission to Mars could be in the 2030s but NASA wants to get
			humans to Mars by 2035. </p>
			
			<p>10. Have you heard of the moon that is bigger than planet
			Mercury? Well Titan is that planet. It is one of the best 
			moons because it has methane liquid lakes and oceans on its
			surface. There is a good chance that alien life exists there. 
			NASA plans to send its Dragonfly Mission to Titan launching 
			in 2026 and arriving in 2034. Dragonfly will fly many miles
			through multiple areas to examine sites around the moon and 
			examine what chemicals are there.</p>
