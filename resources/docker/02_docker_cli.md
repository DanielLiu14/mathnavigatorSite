# Using the Docker Command Line Interface

Use the `docker` CLI to manage a single docker container. Use `docker-compose` to manage multiple docker containers. In addition, you can also double check your active and inactive images with the Docker Desktop application (which you should've installed when you installed Docker).

## Docker-Compose CLI commands
