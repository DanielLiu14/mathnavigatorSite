# Resources for newcomers

If you would like to add a resource, all READMEs are .md files, which are known as Markdown files.
If you would like to edit any READMEs, use this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to help you.
You may edit the file in Github and use the "Preview" feature to see how your edits would look like.
