Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's service to allow smaller businesses easily purchase and manage computer machines.

Before AWS, you would have to buy your own big computers to host your websites or process your organization's data. Once purchased, you're stuck with them and now it's up to you to manually update them and keep them secure.

With AWS, you can "rent" different computers (Linux, Windows, etc.) over the Internet that can be used for your purposes. This is called cloud computing.
If necessary, you can give back computers to save costs or buy more if your business is booming. In addition, if you don't need those computers anymore or want to switch to different computer servers, you can easily do it with a click of a few buttons!

AWS currently hosts billions of machines and millions of different websites. Most websites that you frequently are probably on AWS, Google, or Microsoft cloud computing services.
