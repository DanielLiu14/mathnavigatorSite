# What is epoch time?
The Unix epoch (or Unix timestamp) is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (midnight 00:00).
It starts at this date because that is when the first Unix computer was created.

In addition, the epoch time starts at 0 to represent January 1st, 1970 UTC.
UTC is a timezone which stands for [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).

Computers often like to store in epoch time so that it doesn't get mixed up by timezones or complicated date-time formats.
For instance, certain strings like `12/30/1990 01:00pm EST` can be very painful to parse.
It would be much easier to use a numeric value and convert it to an appropriate String.

You can use this to manually convert between epoch times and "regular human" times.
