## Jenkins

https://jenkins.io/

Jenkins is a Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Integration (CI) tool. It is often used for automatically building a project every time a new feature is merged into Github.

Usually, if you wanted to build your app after a new feature, you would have to call a set of commands to test your app and then create the production version of your app.

CD/CI tools like Jenkins help you automatically do this and can automatically run tests for you to see if your new feature broke any existing features. Usually, these tools simply wait for new commits to be merged into a version control (Github) branch.
