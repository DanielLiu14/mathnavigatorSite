# Resources

If you need to review Git, I highly recommend the following resources:

## For Beginners

- Personal Tutorial and Exercise (made by Aaron)
<https://github.com/ahsu1230/StudentSandbox/>
  - **Highly recommended (Shameless self-promotion)** You'll learn the basics and go through short exercises with using Github's website portal and with using Git on Command Line!

- GitHub's Hello World <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>
  - A quick 10-minute introduction to the basics of creating a repo, creating a branch, making a commit, and then submitting a PR to merge that commit into the main branch, all through the github UI (no cloning, coding, or command line used).

## Intermediate and Advanced

- Review basic concepts
