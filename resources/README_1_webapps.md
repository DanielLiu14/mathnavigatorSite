## Web Applications
Web applications are computer programs that utilize web browsers to perform tasks over the Internet. Web applications usually involve two participants. One participant (the web client) initializes a "request" while the other participant (the web server) "responds" to the request with data. As the user uses the web applications, various requests from the client are sent to the web server. The web server responds with data which the client can then use.

### What is a web client?
A web client is usually an Internet browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) or a mobile application / phone / tablet. Usually, a web client starts the interaction with a web application by sending requests to a web server. For example, going to https://www.facebook.com will contact a Facebook web server to send you the Facebook home page.

### What is a web server?
A web server is a large, highly performant computer owned by a company. A web server's job is to receive requests from various web clients and then deliver information to those clients based on the request. For example, if a client requests user A's profile, the server should deliver ONLY user A's profile content to that client.

### What does front-end and back-end mean?
As you get closer to job searching, you'll often hear about Front-End developers and Back-End developers. Front-end developers work mostly on the web client in an application, while Back-End developers work on the web server. 

Front-end developers may work on websites and mobile applications, and often work with a design or product team to create the best possible experience for users. The languages that Front-end developers use are usually Javascript web frameworks such as AngularJs, ReactJs or languages specific to mobile phones like Android Java or Swift (iOS).

Back-end developers work on the web server. Their job is usually to deliver data to web clients in a timely and efficient manner. Back-end developers use a lot of algorithmic analysis to keep their servers running effectively, no matter the situation. They work with front-end teams and data analyzers to make sure servers are optimized for their needs. Languages that Back-end developers use can be anything from Java, Python, C++, Go, NodeJs, etc.

You can think of it like working in a restaurant. The waiters and waitresses are the front-end developers who make sure their diners are getting the best experience possible while the chefs are the back-end developers, who make the delicious food!

### What is a database?
A database is a huge computer or a large collection of computers that are tasked with storing information. Their job is to not only keep large sets of information safe at all times, but to also be able to retrieve information quickly! Databases usually have their own language such as SQL, which isn't really a programming language. Database languages are built primarily to interact with databases.
