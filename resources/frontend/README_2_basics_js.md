# Javascript basics

https://javascript.info/

I recommend going through the `Fundamentals` and then looking at the following additional topics:
 - 3.1 Debugging in Chrome
 - 3.2 Coding Style
 - 4.1 Objects
 - 5.4 Arrays
 - 5.7 Maps and Sets

To test websites, we use `webpack`.
To test only javascript files, I recommend using `node`. You should already have this if you went through the onboarding.

Once you have it installed, you can simply run Javascript files in your terminal / command.
```
node hello.js
```
And it will run the results of your Javascript file!
