# Install Go
The language of choice we're using is Google's programming language [Golang](https://golang.org/).
Please follow the instructions to download and install Go onto your machine.
Once finished, in your Terminal / DOS, run:
```
go version
```
This will print out the OS and library version of your Golang.
