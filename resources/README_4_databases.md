## What is a database?
A database is simply an organized collection of data. Think like a library which holds tons of information.


## What is a database management system (DBMS)?
A DBMS is a tool / program that allows you to access information from a database. With DBMS, we can create, retrieve, update, or delete our data entries. These 4 operations are what we refer to as CRUD.

The DBMS can also be used to dictate which users has access to which information.

## What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language that is used to perform operations in relational databases.

Modern databases can be split into two types: relational and non-relational. Since we are using SQL, we will only be focusing on relational databases. Most SQL databases are in "table" formats.

## What is MySQL?
MySQL is a DBMS that gives users access to SQL databases.
There are several types of SQL DBMS and MySql is just one of the more popular ones.

## Where is the MySQL machine?
For our purposes, the MySQL machines are handled by AWS (Amazon Web Services). Specifically, they are handled by Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS). Like all AWS machines, these machines are physically located in Amazon data warehouses across the globe.

## I've heard of No-SQL. What is that?
No-SQL are basically non-relational databases. These databases are NOT in "table" format. They can be "document-based", "object-based", "graph-based", "stream-based", etc.

Long story short, different databases have different strengths and weaknesses. Depending on what application you'd like to build, certain databases fit your needs better and sometimes MySQL may not be the answer.

Here's a small list of popular No-SQL databases:
 - Cassandra
 - GraphQL
 - Kafka
 - MongoDb
