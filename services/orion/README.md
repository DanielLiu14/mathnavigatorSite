# Orion
The most famous constellation that can be seen all around the world. This will be our core API service. The user and admin websites will both funnel through this service in order for users to interact with our database.

# Installing Go
The language of choice we're using is Google's programming language Golang (https://golang.org/).

Please follow the instructions to download and install Go onto your machine.
Once finished, in your Terminal / DOS, run:
```
go version
```
This will print out the OS and library version of your Golang.

After that, you can run the server locally using:
```
go run main.go
```
